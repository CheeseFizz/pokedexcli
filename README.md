# PokedexCLI
For a guided project from Boot.Dev

A basic CLI Pokemon "experience" using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) as a datasource.

### Known Issues
I hand jammed every object from PokeAPI into its own struct, for reasons. I know for a fact that I missed every one of the NamedAPIReference types, except for the ones that I needed to get through the project. 

Since [other people](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#wrap) have already done a more robust job, I don't feel any pressing need to fix of the type references in my implementation at this time.
